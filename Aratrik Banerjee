          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I am a passionate tax litigation advocate currently pursuing my legal education at SVKM'S NMIMS Kirit P. Mehta School of Law. I specialize in both direct and indirect taxation, encompassing income tax, international tax, GST, and customs law. With internships at top-tier firms such as Nishith Desai Associates, D. M. Harish & Co., Economic Law Practice, and JAA & Associates, I bring hands-on exposure across litigation, compliance, and tax advisory. My mission is to simplify and demystify the evolving landscape of taxation law in India.
